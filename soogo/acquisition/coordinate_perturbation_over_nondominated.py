    """Coordinate perturbation acquisition function over the nondominated set.

    This acquisition method was proposed in [#]_. It perturbs locally each of
    the non-dominated sample points to find new sample points. The perturbation
    is performed by :attr:`acquisitionFunc`.

    :param acquisitionFunc: A :class:`.CoordinatePerturbation` instance used to
        perform local perturbations around nondominated points. Stored in
        :attr:`acquisitionFunc`.

    .. attribute:: acquisitionFunc

        Coordinate-perturbation acquisition used for local exploration of the
        nondominated set.
