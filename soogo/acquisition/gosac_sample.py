    """GOSAC acquisition function as described in [#]_.

    Minimize the objective function with surrogate constraints. If a feasible
    solution is found and is different from previous sample points, return it as
    the new sample. Otherwise, the new sample is the point that is farthest from
    previously selected sample points.

    This acquisition function is only able to acquire 1 point at a time.

    :param fun: Objective function. Stored in :attr:`fun`.
    :param seed: Seed for random number generator.

    .. attribute:: fun

        Objective function.

    .. attribute:: rng

        Random number generator.
