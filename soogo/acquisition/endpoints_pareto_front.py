    For each component i in the target space, this algorithm solves a cheap
    auxiliary optimization problem to minimize the i-th component of the
    trained surrogate model. Points that are too close to each other and to
    training sample points are eliminated. If all points were to be eliminated,
    consider the whole variable domain and sample at the point that maximizes
    the minimum distance to training sample points.
