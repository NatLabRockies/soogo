    """DYCORS algorithm for single-objective optimization implemented as a
    wrapper to :func:`.surrogate_optimization()`.

    Implementation of the DYCORS (DYnamic COordinate search using Response
    Surface models) algorithm proposed in [#]_. The acquisition function, if not
    provided, is the one used in DYCORS-LMSRBF from Regis and Shoemaker (2012).

    :param acquisitionFunc: Acquisition function to be used. If None, the
        DYCORS acquisition function is used.
    :param seed: Seed for random number generator.
